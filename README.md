# kernel-image-processing


Project made to change input image simulating kernel image processing with selected kernel. 

Note:
Kernel is matrix with same number of rows and columns which will change input image, depending on kernel value. 
To start the processing user has to select kernel (there is few default kernels) or it can be used some original, with desired values.
